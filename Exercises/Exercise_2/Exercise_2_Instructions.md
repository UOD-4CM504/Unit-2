# Exercise 2.2

The area of a rectangle is given by the following formula:

```area = base * height```

***
> # === TASK ===
> Write a program that asks the user to enter the base and the height. Your program should then calculate the area and output the following:
>
>```
>The area of the rectangle with base = X and height = Y is AREA.
>```
>  
> For example if the user inputted ``5.4`` and ``6.2`` the program output in the **console** will look like:
>
>```
>Please enter the base:
>5.4
>Please enter the height:
>6.2
>The area of the rectangle with base = 5.4 and height = 6.2 is 33.48.
>```
>
> You will need to round the area to 2 decimal places to pass one of the tests. You can check out the link below the TASK for how to do this, if you need help then ask in the labs during the practicals.
>
> You should also think about why you need to do this, is it an error in Python?
>
> ***Note that to pass the tests you must have exactly the output above, apart from the numbers which will differ depending on what the user inputs.***
