# Exercise 2.1

The formula to convert a temperature given in Celsius to Fahrenheit is:

```Fahrenheit = (9/5) * Celsius + 32```

***
> # === TASK ===
>
> Write a program that asks the user to enter a temperature in Celsius. Your program should then convert it to Fahrenheit and displays the result in the form:
>
>```
>X Celsius is equivalent to Y Fahrenheit.
>```
> 
> For example if the user inputted 20.2 the program output in the **console** will look like:
>
>```
>Please enter the temperature in Celsius:
>20.2
>20.2 Celsius is equivalent to 68.36 Fahrenheit.
>```
>
> ***Note that to pass the tests you must have exactly the output above, apart from the numbers which will differ depending on what the user inputs.***

***

HINT: You will need to round the Farenheit result to pass one of the tests. You can do this with the ``round()`` function.
