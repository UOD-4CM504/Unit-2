# Exercise 2.5  

A painter has decided that they want a program to calculate how much paint they need to cover a wall. 

The length and height are specified in metres and the painter knows that 1 can of paint covers 20 square metres. 

***
> # === TASK ===
> Create a program to calculate how many cans of paint will be needed to cover a wall of the length and height specified by the user.
> 
> Clearly if you needed 3.7 cans, your program should output 4 cans.
> 
> An example of the program for a length and height of ``10`` and ``3`` is given below.
>
> ```
> Please enter the length of the wall:
> 10
> Please enter the height of the wall:
> 3
> You require 2 cans of paint.
> ```
