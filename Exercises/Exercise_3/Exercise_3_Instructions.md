# Exercise 2.3

A ticket agency wants a program that will calculate the total cost of buying tickets for an event. 

For the event in question, the cost of each ticket is as follows:
 * Child tickets cost £5
 * Adult tickets cost £10
 * Senior tickets cost £8

***
> # === TASK ===
>Write a program that asks the user for the number of each ticket they require and calculates the total price.
>
>Your program should output the following to the user,
>
>```
>Total Price: £X
>```
>where X is the total.
>
>For example if the user inputted ``3`` child, ``4`` adult and ``2`` senior tickets the program output in the **console** will look like:
>
> ```
> How many child tickets would you like?
> 3
> How many adult tickets would you like?
> 4
> How many senior tickets would you like?
> 2
> Total Price: £71
> ```
> 
> ***Note that to pass the tests you must have exactly the output above, apart from the numbers which will differ depending on what the user inputs.***
